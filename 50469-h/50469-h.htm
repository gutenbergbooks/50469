<h3>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer</h3>
<p class="prayer">Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into
temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is
the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever
and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3>The Apostles&rsquo; Creed</h3>
<p class="prayer">I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of
heaven and earth:</p>
<p class="prayer">And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin
Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified,
dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third
day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into
heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the
Father Almighty: From thence he shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="prayer">I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic
Church; The Communion of Saints: The Forgiveness
of sins: The Resurrection of the body: And the Life
everlasting. Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To you who are serving our country in the Army
or the Navy we send this book as a gift from the
Church and a reminder that the Church follows you
into the Service with deep interest. We hope that you
will find these prayers and hymns and Bible readings
a daily help and that they will make real to you

above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption

of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means
of grace, and for the hope of glory. And, we beseech
thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies, that
our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful; and that
we show forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but
in our lives, by giving up our selves to thy service,
and by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness
all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to
whom, with thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honour
and glory, world without end. <i>Amen.</i></p>

Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
